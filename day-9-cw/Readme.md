 Here's a sample `README.md` explaining how the task was accomplished and what JavaScript functionality 

# Div Property Changer

This is a simple web application that allows users to change various properties of a `<div>` element using dropdown menus. The application uses JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and update the properties of the `<div>` in real time.

## Task Accomplished

The goal of the task was to create a web page with 5 dropdown menus that can change the following properties of a `<div>` element:

1. Color of the text
2. Background color
3. Padding
4. Font size
5. Font weight

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code in the HTML file handles the interaction between the dropdown menus and the `<div>` element. Here's a breakdown of the functionality used:

1. **Event Listeners**: Each dropdown menu is associated with an event listener that listens for the "change" event when an option is selected.

2. **DOM Manipulation**: When an option is selected in a dropdown, the corresponding property of the `<div>` element is updated using DOM manipulation. For example, when a color is selected in the "Choose Text Color" dropdown, the `style.color` property of the `<div>` element is updated.

3. **getElementById**: The `getElementById` method is used to get references to the dropdown menus and the `<div>` element in the HTML.

4. **addEventListener**: The `addEventListener` method is used to attach event listeners to the dropdown menus. These listeners trigger the corresponding functions when an option is selected.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Use the dropdown menus to select different options for changing the properties of the `<div>` element. The changes will be reflected in real time.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to dynamically update the properties of HTML elements based on user interactions. It provides a basic example of how dropdown menus can be used to manipulate the appearance of elements on a web page.
