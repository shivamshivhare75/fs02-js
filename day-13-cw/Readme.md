# Catch Me if You Can

This simple web page demonstrates a "Catch Me" div that changes its position when you hover over it. The functionality is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure:** 
   - The HTML file (`index.html`) contains a "Catch Me" div.
   - The div is styled with CSS to give it a fixed size, background color, and some basic formatting.

2. **JavaScript Event Listener:**
   - A JavaScript script within the HTML listens for the `mouseover` event on the "Catch Me" div.

3. **Position Change:**
   - When you hover your mouse over the div, the JavaScript code calculates the maximum X and Y coordinates within the viewport (the visible area of the webpage).

4. **Random Positioning:**
   - It generates random X and Y coordinates within the maximum boundaries.
   - It uses the `transform` CSS property to move the "Catch Me" div to the new random position.

5. **Transition Effect:**
   - A smooth transition effect is applied to the div's movement, creating a visually appealing experience.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the HTML file (`index.html`) and open it in your web browser.

2. Hover your mouse over the "Catch Me" div, and it will change its position to a random spot within the visible area of the webpage.

3. Enjoy catching the div as it moves around!



Happy catching!
