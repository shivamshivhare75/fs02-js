Here's a sample `README.md` explaining how the task was accomplished and what JavaScript functionality was used to complete the task:

# Add Content to &lt;p&gt; Tag

This is a simple web application that allows users to add content to a `<p>` tag using a textbox and an "Add" button. The application uses JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and update the content of the `<p>` tag in real time.

## Task Accomplished

The goal of the task was to create a web page with a textbox and an "Add" button. When the user enters text in the textbox and clicks the "Add" button, the entered text should be appended to a `<p>` tag. Multiple content entries should be added one below another within the `<p>` tag.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code in the HTML file handles the interaction between the textbox, the "Add" button, and the `<p>` tag. Here's a breakdown of the functionality used:

1. **Event Listener**: An event listener is attached to the "Add" button using the `addEventListener` method. This listener triggers a function when the button is clicked.

2. **DOM Manipulation**: When the "Add" button is clicked, the JavaScript code reads the text entered in the textbox, creates a new text node with the entered content, creates a `<br>` element for a new line, and appends both the text node and the `<br>` element to the `<p>` tag.

3. **Whitespace Handling**: The JavaScript code checks if the entered text is empty or contains only spaces. If the text is not empty, it's added to the `<p>` tag. This ensures that only meaningful content is added.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Enter text in the textbox and click the "Add" button. The entered text will be added to the `<p>` tag, one entry below another.

4. You can continue adding more content by entering text and clicking the "Add" button again.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to dynamically update and manipulate the content of HTML elements based on user interactions. It provides a basic example of how text entered in a textbox can be appended to a `<p>` tag to create a list of entries. The application is a simple illustration of DOM manipulation in action.
