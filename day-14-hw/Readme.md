# Digital Clock : 

This project demonstrates how to create a digital clock that displays the current time with AM and PM functionality on a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure
1. Created an HTML file (`index.html`) with a basic structure for the clock.
2. Included a `<div>` element to display the time and a `<script>` tag to link the JavaScript file.

### CSS Styling
1. Created a CSS file (`styles.css`) to style the clock and set the background image.
2. Styled the clock elements, including hours, minutes, seconds, and the colon separator.
3. Set background colors, padding, and other styles to enhance the appearance.

### JavaScript Functionality
1. Created a JavaScript file (`script.js`) to update the clock's time and add AM/PM functionality.
2. Used the `Date` object to get the current time.
3. Determined whether it's AM or PM based on the current hour.
4. Converted the hours to a 12-hour format.
5. Updated the HTML to display the time in the format "hh:mm:ss AM/PM."
6. Utilized `setInterval` to update the time every second, ensuring it stays synchronized with the computer's time.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the project to match your design preferences. You can modify background colors, fonts, and other styles in the CSS file. Additionally, you can enhance the JavaScript code to add more features or change the clock's appearance.
